Exceptions Handling: The program is terminated abnormally is called exception.

Definition: Exception is an event that termintates the program abnormally.

* An unexcepted event that terminates program is called exception.
* Whenever the exception is raised the program will be terminated abnormally and rest of the program will not get executed.
* To overcome this problem we should handle the exception.
* If we handle the exception the program will be executed normally and rest of the application also will get executed.
* The main importance of exeption handling is to get normal termination of the application(program) to execute the rest of the appliation(program) normally.
* It termiates the application normally to execute the rest of the application.
* To get the normal termination of the application and to execute the rest

2 ways to handle the exception:
Approach 1: handle the exception by using try-catch block
Approach2: handle the exception by using throws keyword

Types of exceptions: As per SUN Micro Systems we have three type of exceptions
1. checked exception
2. un-checked exception
3. Error
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
un-checked exception: The exceptions which are not checked by compiler are called un-checked exception.
* If application contains unchecked exception code is compiled but exception raised at run time by JVM.
* If application raises unchecked exception at run time, handle that exception through two approaches either by using try-catch block or by using throws keyword.
