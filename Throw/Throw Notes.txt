We use throw keyword in two situations

Situation Number1: We use throw keyword to handover the user modified predefined exception objects to JVM
throw new ArithmeticException("Raja / by zero");

Situation Number2: 
1. JVM is not responsible to handle the user defined exception or objects.
2. We use throw keyword to handover the user defined exception objects to JVM
3. User uses new keyword to declare an object and to handover the user defined exception to JVM user uses throw keyword
